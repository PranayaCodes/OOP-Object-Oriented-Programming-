// Task To Do

// 1. Write a JAVA program to find the maximum between three numbers.

// 2. Write a JAVA program to check whether a number is negative, positive, or zero.

// 3. Write a JAVA program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.

// 4. Write a JAVA program to check whether a number is even or odd.

// Some Switch case Statements Questions:

// 1. Write a Java program that takes a student's grade as input (A, B, C, D, or F) and converts it to the corresponding GPA value. Use a switch case statement to handle different grades.

// 2. Create a Java program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as inputs and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation using a switch case statement.

// 3. Write a Java program that takes an integer input (1 to 12) representing a month and prints the corresponding season (e.g., 1-3: Winter, 4-6: Spring, 7-9: Summer, 10-12: Fall) using a switch case.

// 4. Implement a Java program that calculates the area of different shapes (circle, rectangle, square, triangle) based on the user's choice using a switch case.
